## Process Improvements Applied

Based on Test 1 (sample extraction) feedback, the following improvements were made to PROCESS.md before Test 2:

1. ✅ **Clarified Iteration 7 metric** - Applies to primary entities only, not sub-entities
2. ✅ **Fixed orphan definition** - Must have NEITHER incoming NOR outgoing relationships
3. ✅ **Added bidirectional count note** - Imbalances are expected when entities are shared
4. ✅ **Added extraction scope guidance** - Distinguish test vs full extraction
5. ✅ **Added sample size recommendation** - 5-10 primary entities for testing
6. ✅ **Standardized confidence scores** - VERY HIGH/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW definitions

## Code Trimming Results

Removed obsolete Python code templates from PROCESS.md, replacing with concise AI-first guidance:

- **Phase 3**: 1,951 lines → 222 lines (88% reduction)
- **Phase 3.5**: 260 lines → 168 lines (35% reduction)
- **Phase 4**: 540 lines → 133 lines (75% reduction)
- **Total**: 8,379 lines → 6,248 lines (25% reduction)

Result: Cleaner, more focused AI-first process guide.

## Query Capabilities Enabled

The extracted knowledge graph enables:

1. **Service Discovery**: "Find all services with cost center 148"
2. **Dependency Analysis**: "What services depend on GitHub?"
3. **Owner Queries**: "Show all services owned by user X"
4. **Endpoint Mapping**: "List all endpoints for acs-fleet-manager"
5. **Code Component Tracking**: "Find all repositories for service Y"
6. **Analytics**: Count services by onboarding status, tier, criticality
